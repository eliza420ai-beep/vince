I’m not a developer. I’m the guy who’s been here since 2016 and still can’t find the one product I would actually use every week for the rest of my life. While the rest of the world is busy turning perpetual futures into a $2 trillion monthly casino, traditional finance has already placed its vote: Options: $12 trillion annual notional. That’s not a market gap. That’s three orders of magnitude.

If onchain options ever capture just 1 % of TradFi’s volume, that’s $120 billion a day — 60× the size of the entire onchain derivatives market today.

## Context

The inversion is happening right now. BlackRock, Nasdaq, Dubai, Singapore — the adults are quietly building the parallel financial system while we keep polishing the casino. And the single most obvious alpha in this entire shift?

A boring, weekly + monthly covered-call / cash-secured-put vault that actually works. No 0DTE memes. No 40× leverage. No harvest button. Just a vault that:

> Sells out-of-the-money weekly and monthly calls (and puts) on BTC, ETH, HYPE. Delta-hedges instantly using Orderly Network’s omnichain perp liquidity — the deepest orderbook that actually exists on-chain today. Auto-compounds every single sat of premium back into more underlying or the next sale. Gives me one clean ERC-20 share that goes up every week like a better, permissionless version of BlackRock’s BUIDL. Charges a fair 15/2 fee.

HyperSurface already proved people will throw tens of millions into manual covered-call strategies. Rysk proved the demand is real. Both also proved we’re one generation behind. That generation is over. The stack is live today:

## Main

- Orderly Network = CEX-grade depth, sub-200 ms fills, no bridges

- Pyth + Chainlink = bulletproof pricing

- Gelato or cron contracts = fully automated weekly/monthly rolls

- One clean Solidity vault = the rest

All that’s missing is someone to ship it.

I will be user #1. I already have a quiet circle of TradFi whales who live on covered calls and cash-secured puts who are waiting with fat wallets the moment the contract is verified and audited.

We don’t need a token, governance, or a twelve-month roadmap.

We need the one product that turns crypto from a casino into actual capital markets. If you’re a builder (solo, duo, or small team) who can ship this clean, auto-piloted, auto-compounding options vault — reply here, DM me, or just post “building” and tag me. I’ll be the first deposit, the loudest shill, and I’ll open doors to every other whale who’s been waiting years for this exact thing.

The TAM is measured in tens of trillions. The tech is here. The demand is proven. Stop building another perps frontend. Build the thing that actually eats traditional finance for breakfast. Take my deposit and let’s f$cking go.

UPDATE: Nothing has been built yet that meets the bar I laid out, and that’s fine. The bar was deliberately high: CEX-grade depth, zero trust assumptions, audited to death, no governance theater, just a machine that sells premium, delta-hedges on-chain, and compounds forever. I still believe the first team that ships it clean will capture a river of fees measured in billions annually. I also still have zero intention of building it myself. My job is to map the asymmetry and then write checks or make the deposit, not to debug keepers at 4 a.m.

The original letter leaned on Orderly’s omnichain perp book for delta-hedging because it was the deepest liquidity available. That was correct in mid-2025. It is no longer the only correct path, and it might not even be the best one anymore. The new winning design, the one that will actually eat Deribit instead of just competing with Aevo ribbons, looks nothing like a traditional options protocol and everything like a volatility-powered concentrated-liquidity engine.

Here is how it works in practice, and why it obsoletes every previous attempt. You deposit BTC or ETH (or HYPE, or any asset with a decent pool). The vault instantly sells you an OTM weekly or monthly covered call or cash-secured put for a fixed premium paid upfront in stablecoin. You walk away happy. The vault now has a short-gamma obligation to deliver either all underlying or all stable at expiry. Instead of sending that collateral to a CEX or a perp book, the vault deploys one hundred percent of it as concentrated liquidity on a HyperSwap-style CLAMM (HyperEVM, Berachain, Monad, MegaETH, wherever the deepest pool lives). The range is centered precisely at the strike price that makes the option expire worthlessly or in-the-money. As spot price moves, keeper bots rebalance the range along a perfect delta-hedging curve. Every single rebalance collects trading fees from the pool. Over the life of the option those fees compound to more than cover the premium that was paid out at inception. In high-vol weeks the vault over-earns and keeps the excess. In boring sideways weeks it barely breaks even. At expiry the position is already ninety-nine percent in the correct asset because the continuous hedging gradually pushed it there; no heroic final swap, no slippage panic.

> Zero custody. Zero funding-rate bleed. Zero counterparty beyond the AMM itself. Works on any token that has a pool. Capital efficiency near one hundred percent because the collateral is always working. Gas is batched and threshold-triggered exactly like Lyra Avalon or Hypersurface keepers. Premiums can be richer than Deribit weeklies because the vault harvests LP yield that no CEX market-maker ever sees. This is the design Hypersurface pioneered on HyperEVM and that a handful of teams are quietly refining right now. It is the only architecture I have seen that can genuinely scale to institutional trillions without compromising on the non-custodial promise. Everything else is still a science project or a thinly veiled CEX wrapper.

So the open letter still stands, but the technical appendix just got rewritten. The builder who ships the cleanest, most over-audited, whale-friendly version of the concentrated-liquidity volatility-harvesting vault will not be competing with Ribbon or Aevo or Rysk. They will be competing with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and they will win on every dimension that matters to anyone with a nine-figure balance. Spreads already proved the philosophy replicates across market regimes. The options version is next. It will not be built by me. It will be built by the small team that finally gets tired of watching the same asymmetry sit unclaimed. Until then, I’ll keep deploying into the few products that already meet the bar, and I’ll keep the deposit address warm. Build it. Take my money.

Real-world comps (2024–2025 numbers)

- Hypersurface (the exact design you described on Hyperliquid) → crossed $500 million TVL in months purely on 15–20% performance fees.

- Spreads Finance (same architecture on Berachain) → similar fee structure, already >$200 million TVL.

## Conclusion

- Ribbon Finance in 2021–2022 bull → peaked at ~$4 billion TVL taking 10% + 2% and generated tens of millions in fees per quarter.

This vault, done clean (no governance token, no points, no liquidity mining, just a boring machine that prints 12–25% net yield on BTC/ETH forever), will charge roughly the same and at $10–50 billion TVL will throw off $300 million – $2 billion in annual fee revenue with almost zero operating cost beyond audits and keeper infra. That is the entire business model. No token needed. No roadmap theater. Just take 15–20% of the yield, let the vault compound the rest, and watch institutions and whales stack until the TVL curve goes parabolic. The revenue isn’t the hard part. The hard part is shipping it so clean that a $500 million whale sends it all on day-1 without asking a single question. Everything else (liquidity, pricing, automation) is already solved. The fee river is waiting.
