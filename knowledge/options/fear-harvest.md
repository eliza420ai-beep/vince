Bitcoin’s been through the wringer this year, hasn’t it? We’re sitting here on November 21, 2025, staring at a chart that’s more red than a bad Tinder date. From that euphoric $126K peak in late October, we’ve cliff-dived over 35% to around $82,400 spot, with ETF outflows bleeding billions—the worst since those spot beasts launched back in ‘24. And the liquidations? Holy cascade, Batman. Coinglass and the headlines are screaming about the October 10th bloodbath: a record-shattering $19.16 billion wiped out in a single day, dwarfing the FTX implosion ($6-8B range) and even the COVID Black Thursday panic ($4-10B across events).

That’s not just degens getting rekt; that’s institutional longs vaporizing in real time. The perp cowboys on 50x leverage? Gone. The “BTC to $250K by EOY” prophets? Probably selling plasma to cover margin calls.

## Context

Me? I listened to that inner voice last week and kept the options holstered—no deploys amid the gamma frenzy. Wise call, because even delta-neutral setups can get whipsawed in that kind of vol storm. But now, with the dust settling (kinda), this is prime time for our Weekly BTC Options Yield Engine. When implied volatility (IV) explodes post-crash—Deribit’s DVOL index spiked to levels not seen since FTX, inflating premiums like a helium balloon—this is when selling OTM options turns into a veritable money printer. We’re not here to predict the bounce or the bottom; we’re volatility farmers, harvesting fear premiums while the timeline melts down.

**I’ve refined our playbook. **

The core remains rock-solid: symmetric covered calls and cash-secured puts on Hypersurface’s weekly on-chain expiries, isolated to a 5% yield bucket. But we’re layering in smarter adaptations for high-fear regimes—lower deltas, put-heavy skew leans, and a rolling protocol to handle those rare assignment squeaks. This isn’t just yield; it’s antifragile income that thrives on chaos.

## Main

Portfolio Backbone: Keep the Core Sacred, Expose the Edge

Quick recap for the uninitiated (or those still shaking off the dip PTSD): Our total stack is xx BTC, worth about $xM at current $82,400 spot. We carve out exactly 1 BTC (~$82K) for the yield engine, plus $90K in separate USDT collateral. The mighty xx BTC core? Untouched, unlevered, unflappable—no liquidation risk, ever. This is institutional-grade compartmentalization: treat the yield bucket like a side hustle that prints $4K+/month without jeopardizing the farm.

Why it works in a crash? Liquidations like October’s $19B monster force-sell billions in BTC, crushing spot while juicing IV. Result: Options sellers (us) get paid absurd premiums for strikes that rarely get touched. Historical analogs confirm—during COVID’s $9-10B wipes or FTX’s cascade, wide OTM sellers banked while longs bled. We’re on the right side of that trade.

**The Upgraded Legs: Wider, Smarter, Put-Biased for Fear Markets**

In calm times, we ran 5-7% OTM strikes at 30-40 delta. Post-meltdown? IV crush hasn’t fully hit yet, so we’re widening out and leaning into the put skew (puts get pricier in downtrends). Target: 20-30 delta across the board.

Hypersurface’s UI makes this brainless—slide to “20-30% Probability” and watch the APRs light up.

**Covered Call Leg (Upside Harvest)**

- Strike: 8-12% OTM, e.g., $89K-$92K at $82.4K spot.

- Delta: 20-25 (super safe—assignment odds plummet in bear vibes).

- Collateral: 0.5-0.75 BTC from the yield bucket (scale down if paranoid).

- Premium: $900-$1,200/week in this IV regime (lingering bull hopium).

- Why upgrade? Low delta avoids the “sell high, miss higher” trap.

**Cash-Secured Put Leg (Downside Discount Buyer)**

- Strike: 10-15% OTM, e.g., $70K-$74K.

- Delta: 20-30 (puts are the star here—skew means fatter rewards).

- Collateral: $60K-$75K USDT.

- Premium: $1,400-$1,800/week—insane, because fear prices in doomsday that rarely hits.

- Why bias puts? Crashes like October’s amplify put IV more than calls.

Total weekly haul on 0.75 BTC + $75K USDT: $2,300-$3,000 right now. That’s $9K-$12K/month, smashing our $4K target. Scale conservatively—high IV means bigger swings, but our isolation keeps it chill.

**Greeks Intel: Why 20-30 Delta Is the Sweet Spot in Chaos**

Deep research validates our zone: Delta (Hypersurface’s “Probability”) measures true ITM odds, balancing premium vs. risk. Below 20? Peanuts. Above 40? Assignment city. At 20-30, we capture ~75-85% expiry worthless rate, per historical BTC vol (weekly moves ±3-5% even in crashes).

Theta decay ramps in the final 72 hours—weeklies maximize that.

Vega? Our edge—IV often overshoots realized vol post-liquidation, so we sell rich options.

Gamma’s tamed by staying deep OTM.

Avoid the traps: No <20 delta poverty premiums, no >50 delta assignment roulette. Know the risks—deep drawdowns or missed moons—but long-term BTC believers win either way.

**New Layer: Rolling Protocol for When Things Get Spicy**

Here’s the improvement sauce: Fixed weeklies are great for theta, but if a leg creeps ITM mid-week (rare, but gamma happens), we roll.

- If put nears strike (BTC dipping hard): Roll to next weekly, same/lower strike, net credit. Keeps premium flowing, avoids early assignment.

- If call threatens: Roll up/out for credit—lock gains without selling BTC.

- Threshold: Delta >50 mid-week. Hypersurface supports easy rolls; do it Thursday if needed.

**Macro Response: Adapt, Don’t React**

High fear (ETF bleeds, tariff echoes from October)? Widen further, put-heavy. Calm rebound (Nvidia pops, inflows return)? Tighten to 5-8% OTM. Extreme assignment? Reset bucket from core—no permaloss, just reposition.

**Execution Cycle: Monday Magic, Friday Feast**

- Monday 10AM ET: Scan Hypersurface APRs, set 20-30 delta strikes. Fund USDT. Deploy strangle.

- Mid-week check: Roll if delta spikes.

- Friday expiry: Pocket premiums (75-85% win) or rejoice in assignment (discounted BTC or sold high). Withdraw/repeat.

**No perps bleed, no leverage roulette—just math.**

We’re volatility farmers, not directional gamblers. Hypersurface on-chain weeklies. That’s the religion. Why We Will NEVER Touch Perps Again (And You Shouldn’t Either). Look at the graveyard: $19 billion liquidated in one October day, the vast majority long perps. Binance literally buckled. Funding rates were +200% annualized at the top—degens paying institutions 4% a week just to stay long. Then the cascade hit and it was goodnight Vienna. Perps are a rigged casino disguised as “efficient exposure”:

- You pay funding on winners, you get liquidated on losers.

- One 8% wick and your entire position is gone forever—no premium collected, no second chance.

- The house (exchange + market makers) wins on every volatility spike.

Our options engine is the polar opposite:

- We collect premium upfront—money in pocket Day 1.

- No funding bleed, no liquidation level, no forced close.

- Worst case on assignment? We sell BTC near recent highs or buy it 12–15% cheaper than spot. That’s a win disguised as a loss.

- In the current environment we’re pulling 2–3% per week net while perp longs just handed us their stacks.

Perps are for adrenaline junkies and people who hate money. We’re here to compound quietly while the casino burns. Options only, forever.

**The Stability Playbook – What We Do When the Bull Returns**

Once the storm passes—ETF inflows resume, funding flips negative, IV collapses back to 40–55%—we flip the switch to “grind mode.” The engine stays exactly the same, we just tighten up for higher win rate and steadier (but still juicy) yield.

**Stable/Bull Regime Settings:**

- Strikes: 4–7% OTM on both sides (e.g., spot $100K → sell $105K–$107K calls + $93K–$95K puts)

- Delta target: 30–40 (back to the classic zone)

- Sizing: Ramp back to full 1 BTC calls + $90K puts

- Bias: Symmetric or slight call-heavy if we’re in euphoric chop

- Expected weekly premium: $1,100–$1,500 → $4,400–$6,000/month (still crushing any boring yield play)

Why tighten?

- Lower IV means less vega juice, but realized vol drops even harder → 4–7% OTM now expires worthless 80%+ of weeks.

- Higher delta = bigger premium per unit of risk when assignment odds are tiny.

- We still keep the xx-BTC core sacred and the yield bucket isolated.

It’s the same exact machine, just two gears:

- Crash gear (current) → wide strikes, put bias, monster premiums, lower win rate but massive payouts.

- Bull/chop gear (coming soon) → tight strikes, symmetric, boringly consistent 1–1.5% per week forever.

**Monday Ritual (Works in Both Regimes)**

- Check spot + Hypersurface APR board

- Decide regime (fear = widen + put lean, calm = tighten + symmetric)

- Slide probability to target delta zone

- Sell the strangle

- Go live life—theta does the rest

- Optional Thursday roll if something gets spicy

- Friday: collect or get assigned (both good outcomes)

**Closing Vibes**

This crash hurts on paper, but it’s the best thing that could’ve happened to our yield engine. We’re printing harder than ever with zero liquidation risk while the perp bros became exit liquidity… again.

When the bull comes back (and history says it will be violent), we just shift gears and keep farming—tighter, steadier, still $5K+/month on autopilot.

No leverage. No funding bleed. No emotions. Just isolated, antifragile, compounding yield in every market regime.

Sell the fear now, tighten up later, stack forever.

Volatility Farmer, signing off.

## Conclusion

Not financial advice, DYOR, manage risk, etc.

But man… these premiums are stupid right now.
