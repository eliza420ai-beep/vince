## [v2.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### 🎭 Dream Team Complete — 8 Agents

The full roster is now live. Clear lanes, no overlap.

| Role | Agent | Lane |
|------|-------|------|
| CEO | Eliza | Knowledge base, research |
| CDO | VINCE | Objective data: options, perps, prices |
| **CSO** | **ECHO** | **CT sentiment, X research, social alpha** |
| **CPO** | **Oracle** | **Prediction markets: Polymarket (read-only)** |
| CFO | Solus | Trading execution, strike selection |
| COO | Otaku | DeFi ops, wallet, yields |
| CVO | Kelly | Lifestyle: travel, dining, health |
| CTO | Sentinel | Ops, code, infra |

**Design Principle:**
- Data agents (VINCE, ECHO, Oracle) → inform, don't execute
- Execution agents (Solus, Otaku) → trade, execute
- Support agents (Eliza, Kelly, Sentinel) → knowledge, lifestyle, ops
